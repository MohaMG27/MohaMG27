- 👋 Hi, I’m @MohaMG27
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ and Game Development...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing :/ 
- 📫 How to reach me : nothing yet
- ⚡ Fun fact: there is no fun fact :/

i dont know what im doing... im just learing c++ so i dont have a rough learning another language. and im having fun dispite my poor skills in, 70%
of the things needed? and i dont why am i wasting my time typing in this .md file that no one will ever read. ill just move on, i have my last 
highschool year to finish. ill continue on programmeing tho, these stuff are fun as hell. i am so ambitious that i want to learn neovim to be my
text editor instead of VSCode (:, i really like the idea of doing all text editing in the terminal. and its not because i feel like a hacker doing 
stuff in the terminal(altho it might be, cuz its very cool), it just make sense to me to edit code in a non-gui environment. the mouse is really 
slow at accomplishing things. i embrace the keyboard more!

ok time to move on fr this time |:, i like typing my thoughts out.
